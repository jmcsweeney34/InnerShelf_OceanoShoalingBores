# InnerShelf_AlongShoreVariability
A subproject of the Inner Shelf DRI (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/projects/innershelf/) that focuses on the properties and cross-shore evolution of shoaling nonlinear bores.  This project uses a subset of the ISDRI data - the "Oceano" mooring array.  These analyses are currently in revision at JPO (manuscript on request).
